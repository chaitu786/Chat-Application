<p>
The Farmer-fertilizer website which will help to formers. And this project made by me and my team creativity and the concept of the website is purely new and its completely dedicated to farmers. The Farmers, when they get any problem like any diseases while crop growing simply they can upload their issue in our website with simple steps and experts are going to suggest to farmers about the diseases and they are are going to suggest which medicines need to cure that and our website can use fertilizers with different roles and they are going to delivery the medicines to the farmers according their need. If any farmer want to chat with fertilizer or any experts they can chat with each other using chatting feature. And Farmer or Ferilizer want to see the weather reports they can find through our website as well according to the location.
